Get ghc from fpco:

  git clone git@github.com:fpco/ghc

Checkout the ide-backend branch of 7.4.2:

  git checkout ide-backend-experimental

Get packages, and checkout the 7.4.2 branches:

  ./sync-all --no-dph -r http://darcs.haskell.org get
  ./sync-all checkout -b ghc-7.4.2 ghc-7.4.2-release

and make sure we're still in the experimental branch of ghc:
  
  git checkout ide-backend-experimental

Now build as usual: 

  cp mk/build.mk.sample mk/build.mk

then edit mk/build.mk to use the quick build flavour, and finally

  perl boot
  ./configure 
  make -j8
