Haddock conclusions
===================

Pretty-printing of types
------------------------

The types in an export list of an interface file are represented by HsType
DocName ; that is, an HsType with DocNames for identifiers; DocName is defined by 

  data DocName = Documented Name Module | Undocumented Name

where the 'Module' is the elusive home module. Note that this is only a Module,
not a Module and a PackageId. Haddock maintains a global mutable variable
(html_xrefs_ref) that maps module names to FilePaths (which include the full
package ID). 

Construction of interface files
-------------------------------

So the question is, where are these DocNames generated?
