===========

Compile and test with

    cabal install --enable-tests


The API is in IdeSession.hs. It can be formatted nicely for viewing with

A sample program using the ide-backend library can be invoked as follows

    dist/build/typecheck-dir/typecheck-dir

Fell free to file issues on the github tracker.
